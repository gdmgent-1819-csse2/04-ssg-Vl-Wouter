It is a vector put in a two-dimensional space. The vector only has two coordinates: x and y. These have to be filled in in order to make this work.<br>\nLet's start by creating the class and a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {\n        this.x = xpos\n        this.y = ypos\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The vector class also required quite a few functions to make it do what we want it to do.</p>\n<h2>Functions</h2>\n<h3>Basic vector operations</h3>\n<p>The vector has a few basic operations like add(), sub() and scalar()</p>\n<h4>add() {#add}</h4>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2019","path":"/docs/classes/vector-classes","title":"Vector Classes","chapter":null,"chapter_title":"Classes","chapter_path":"docs/classes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
