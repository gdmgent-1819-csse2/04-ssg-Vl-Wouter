We will use it to perform some mathematical functions with either vectors or just numbers. The two-dimensional matrix is also known as a 2x2 matrix.<br>\nJust like the vector, this class needs a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Matrix2 {\n    constructor(elements) {\n        this.elements = elements || [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see we addeds a default value for the elements in case none are passed to the function. This is to prevent any errors if you forget to give it any values.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice:</strong> You can now go back to your Vector2 class, and import the Matrix2 class:</p>\n<p>Vector2.js</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import Matrix2 from 'path/to/Matrix2.js'\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2019","path":"/docs/classes/matrix-classes","title":"Matrix Classes","chapter":1.2,"chapter_title":"Classes","chapter_path":"docs/classes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
