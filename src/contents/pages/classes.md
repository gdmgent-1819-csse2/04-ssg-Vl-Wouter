To build our WebGL2 example, we will need some classes.  
The application makes use of two types of classes: [Vector Classes](/docs/classes/vector-classes) and [Matrix Classes](/docs/classes/matrix-classes). These classes will be part of the base of our application, together with shaders, buffers and programs (see source code). This first chapter will cover the two classes we will need and how to make them. If you already know or have these, feel free to skip.
