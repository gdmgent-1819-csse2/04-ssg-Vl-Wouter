A vector can be described as a point in space, depending on dimensions.<br>\nThese vectors are the basis of our example, but they will also need the help of the <a href=\"/docs/classes/matrix-classes\">Matrix</a> to function properly.</p>\n<h2>The two-dimensional vector</h2>\n<p>This is the most basic vector. It is a vector put in a two-dimensional space. The vector only has two coordinates: x and y. These have to be filled in in order to make this work.<br>\nLet's start by creating the class and a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {\n        this.x = xpos\n        this.y = ypos\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The vector class also requires functions to make it do what we want it to do.</p>\n<h2>Functions</h2>\n<h3>Basic vector operations</h3>\n<p>The vector has a few basic operations like <a href=\"#add-function\">add()</a>, <a href=\"#sub-function\">sub()</a> and <a href=\"#scalar-function\">scalar()</a></p>\n<h4><a name=\"add-function\"></a> add()</h4>\n<p>The add function allows us to add the coordinates of 2 vectors. Exactly like the name of the function says.-+87Âµ$puyer</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {...}\n\n    add(secondVector) {\n        this.x += secondVector.x\n        this.y += secondVector.y\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What happens in this function is the following. We'll call this function with a second vector. The function will then add the coordinates of the second vector to the first vector, to move that first vector to a different place in our two-dimensional space.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"sub-function\"></a> sub()</h4>\n<p>The sub() function is built similarily to the add() function, but it's function is the exact opposite. Instead of adding a second vector to it to move the original vector, it will subtract the second vector from the original one.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {...}\n\n    add(secondVector) {...}\n\n    sub(secondVector) {\n        this.x -= secondVector.x\n        this.y -= secondVector.y\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a name=\"scalar-function\"></a> scalar()</h4>\n<p>Scalar also is a basic function for our vector class. It allows us to multiply the coordinates of the vector by any given amount.<br>\nThe construction of this function is similar to the two mentioned above, but instead of a second vector, we will pass an integer value to this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {...}\n\n    add(secondVector) {...}\n\n    sub(secondVector) {...}\n\n    scalar(scale) {\n        this.x *= scale\n        this.y *= scale\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Advanced vector operations</h3>\n<p>These are the more complex operations within the vector. These operations are <a href=\"#norm-function\">norm()</a>, <a href=\"#dot-function\">dot()</a> and <a href=\"#rot-function\">rot()</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"norm-function\"></a> norm()</h4>\n<p>The norm function calculates and returns the length of a vector using both the x and y position of said vector. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    ...\n    scalar(scale) {...}\n\n    norm() {\n        return Math.sqrt(this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It looks a bit more complicated than it actually is. What the function does is take the square number of both the x and y coordinate, add these together and take the square root of that number. The result is the length of the vector.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"dot-function\"></a> dot()</h4>\n<p>This function will calculate the dot product of 2 vectors. It multiplies the x coordinate of the first vector with the x coordinate of the second vector, and does the same for the y coordinate. It then returns the sum of the multiplied coordinates as a result.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    ...\n    scalar(scale) {...}\n\n    norm() {...}\n\n    dot(secondVector) {\n        return this.x * secondVector.x + this.y * secondVector.y\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2019","path":"/docs/classes/vector-classes","title":"Vector Classes","chapter":null,"chapter_title":"Classes","chapter_path":"docs/classes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
