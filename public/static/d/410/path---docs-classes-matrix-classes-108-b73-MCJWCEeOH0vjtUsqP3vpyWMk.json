We have to start at the beginning first.</p>\n<h2>The two-dimensional Matrix</h2>\n<p>Unlike in the movies, this matrix is actually real. We will use it to perform some mathematical functions with either vectors or just numbers. The two-dimensional matrix is also known as a 2x2 matrix.<br>\nJust like the vector, this class needs a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Matrix2 {\n    constructor(elements) {\n        this.elements = elements || [0, 0, 0, 0]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see we added a default value for the elements in case none are passed to the function. This is to prevent any errors if you forget to give it any values.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice:</strong> You can now go back to your Vector2 class, and import the Matrix2 class:</p>\n<p>Vector2.js</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import Matrix2 from 'path/to/Matrix2.js'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just like the vector class, the matrix needs functions to work:</p>\n<h2>Matrix operations</h2>\n<h3>Basic operations</h3>\n<p>The Matrix2 class has some basic operations to do simple mathematical operations. These are <a href=\"#add-function\">add()</a> and <a href=\"#sub-function\">sub()</a>.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"add-function\"></a> add()</h4>\n<p>The add operation in a matrix is similar to the one in the vector. You take one value and add another value to it, repeat for all values.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Matrix2 {\n    constructor(elements) {...}\n\n    add(secondMatrix) {\n        const firstMatrix = this.elements\n        this.elements = [\n                firstMatrix[0] + secondMatrix[0], firstMatrix[1] + secondMatrix[1],\n                firstMatrix[2] + secondMatrix[2], firstMatrix[3] + secondMatrix[3],\n        ]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2019","path":"/docs/classes/matrix-classes","title":"Matrix Classes","chapter":1.2,"chapter_title":"Classes","chapter_path":"docs/classes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
