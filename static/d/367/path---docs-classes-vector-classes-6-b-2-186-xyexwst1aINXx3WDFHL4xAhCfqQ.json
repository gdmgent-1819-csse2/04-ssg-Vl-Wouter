A vector can be described as a point in space, depending on dimensions.<br>\nThese vectors are the basis of our example, but they will also need the help of the <a href=\"/docs/classes/matrix-classes\">Matrix</a> to function properly.</p>\n<h2>The two-dimensional vector</h2>\n<p>This is the most basic vector. It is a vector put in a two-dimensional space. The vector only has two coordinates: x and y. These have to be filled in in order to make this work.<br>\nLet's start by creating the class and a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export default class Vector2 {\n    constructor(xpos, ypos) {\n        this.x = xpos\n        this.y = ypos\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The vector class also required quite a few functions to make it do what we want it to do.</p>\n<h2>Functions</h2>\n<h3>Basic vector operations</h3>\n<p>The vector has a few basic operations like <a href=\"#add-function\">add()</a>, <a href=\"#sub-function\">sub()</a> and scalar()</p>\n<h4><a name=\"add-function\"></a> add()</h4>\n<p>We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down. So turn the volume loud. 'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.. So, baby, make just like K-Fed. And let yourself go, let yourself go. Say \"Fuck it!\" before we kick the bucket. Life's too short to not go for broke. So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah.</p>\n<h4><a name=\"sub-function\"></a> sub()</h4>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2019","path":"/docs/classes/vector-classes","title":"Vector Classes","chapter":null,"chapter_title":"Classes","chapter_path":"docs/classes"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
